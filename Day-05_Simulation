1535. Find the Winner of an Array Game

STATEMENT
Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.
A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]). 
In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0, 
and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.
Return the integer which will win the game.
It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.

SOLUTION

C++
class Solution
{
public:
    int getWinner(vector<int>& arr, int k)
    {
        if(k==1)
        {
            return std::max(arr[0], arr[1]);
        }
        if(k>=arr.size())
        {
            return *std::max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        }

        int winner=arr[0];
        int cnt=0;

        for(int i=1; i<arr.size(); i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]<winner)
            {
                cnt++;

                if(cnt==k)
                {
                    return winner;
                }
            }

            else
            {
                winner=arr[i];
                cnt=1;
            }
        }

        return winner;
    }
};
